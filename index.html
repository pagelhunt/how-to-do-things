        <h2>This is how to do things.</h2>

        <h3>A non-comprehensive guide on how to do many different things.</h3>

        <h2>Why though?</h2>

        <p>Why make this? Well the reason is simple. To teach you how to do many things and to even remind/reteach myself the things that I know how to do.</p>
        <p>Most of the things that I will be going over is gonna be tech related, but as this project goes on the variety may or may not change based on my own whims.</p>
        <p>This is by no means a comprehensive guide on how to do many of these things but I will provide a basic overview of the topics listed below, along with a little extra that I picked up along the way.</p>
