        <p> Here I will cover how to do things with CS (computer science) also known as programming or coding. To be honest there's more that goes along with CS than just writing code. However if I choose to cover those things remains to be seen.</p>
        <p>I will place these langauges that I choose to cover below along with a very biased diffuculty ranking. (if i choose to get really fancy with things, perhaps i'll just cover topics and have the code change based on what you click!) </p>
        <p>I will covers topics in such a way where no previous experience is required and each topic will build on the last.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Here is the order is would rank the various langauges I know. There are a few more that I may learn in the future.</p>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript --Easy (too a degree)</li>
            <li>C# --Intermediate</li>
            <li>Java --Intermediate (very similar to C#)</li>
            <li>C++ --Hardest</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>The following is a list of various CS techniques that I will be covering:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Getting Started</li>
            <li>Variables</li>
            <li>Control Flow Part 1</li>
            <li>CF Part 2</li>
            <li>Functions</li>
            <p>----Advanced Topics----</p>
            <li>Classes Part 1</li>
            <li>Classes Part 2 (Inheritance)</li>
            <li>Classes Part 3 (Polymorphism)</li>
            <li>Data Structures</li>
            <li>Algorithms</li>
