    <h1>Unity</h1>

    <p>Welcome to How To Unity. The following guide will give you the basics of creating your own Unity projects and many tip and trick I've learned during my multi-year journey of creating games.</p>
    <p>This guide does not have any assets to provide you with and I will attempt to try to make do with primitive objects created with only the engine, as they are not needed to create interesting prototypes. 
        There are in fact a few sucessful games that are made using only shapes. Making interesting shapes using the models can be surprisingly easy even without the use of outside assets. I will cover importing your own assets as well. The process is actually quite easy.</p>
